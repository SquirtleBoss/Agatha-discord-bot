Ideas is a discord bot that uses the GPT-3 models from OpenAI to assist with writing. From creative writing to drafting an email, there are always times when the author becomes 'stuck' and can use a little assistance. 

## Commands

**/ask**

Give it a question and it will answer to the best of its abilities. 

> It is not connected to the internet so timely questions such as "What's the weather like today" will not be accurate. 

**/feedback**

Give it a piece of writing and it will give you feedback on how it can be improved

> The max input length is about a page (bottlenecked from the discord API). Best used for complete pieces of writing such as essays or emails.

**/list**

Give it a prompt and it will return a list of 5 items fitting that prompt

> This is great for idea generation e.g. "/list funny ways a character can get stuck in the washing machine"

**/re-write**

Give it a sentence or piece of writing and it will rewrite it.

> Sometimes the idea is there, but putting it into proper English is difficult. Type it out as best as you can and see how it gets rewritten!

**/sentence-completion**

Give it a half written sentence and it will finish it.

> Sometimes the idea isn't quite there, type out the half thought out idea and see how it completes the thought!

**/write**

Give it something to write and it will write it for you.

> Be aware: there are tools that can detect if something is written by GPT, so don't use it for important documents.
